		h2#dub-registry The DUB registry

		p Vibe.d and it's <a href="https://github.com/rejectedsoftware/">sister projects</a> are all distributed in the form of DUB packages. DUB is a package and build manager for D projects. The <a href="http://code.dlang.org/">DUB registry</a> provides a central place for publishing D applications and libraries. All packages registered there can be used by simply adding a corresponding entry into the package.json file of a project. So if you are searching for advanced functionality or if you have a project which you'd like to make available, this is the right place.
